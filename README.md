  # Welcome to Tech Odyssey blog

## WebApp with React JS and Flask API

“Tech Odyssey blog” is an app where you can post and read reviews and opinions related to technology. There are 4 main themes like computers, movies related to tech, artificial inteligence and electric mobility as well as other topics that the user may find relevant.
On the main page you’ll find the 3 most recent posts and the posts listed by category where you can find an abstract and a link to the main post. Then there is a brief description of blog’s propose.<br>
After login or create account the user can create a post where can upload an image to wrap with the text.<br>
There is a “My Stuff” section where users can find their profile (“My Profile” subsection) with their information and a list of the posts created by them where posts can be deleted. There’s also a subsection, “My Readings” where users can find the posts they want to read later and after that they can delete from the reading list.<br>
Finally, the user can view the post in its entirety via the link on the main page, “My Profile” section or from “My Readings” that takes them to the single view page where they can add the post to the reading list.

### Instruction to test this Webapp


Build web applications using React.js for the front end and python/flask for your backend API.

- Documentation can be found here: https://start.4geeksacademy.com/starters/react-flask
- Here is a video on [how to use this template](https://www.loom.com/share/f37c6838b3f1496c95111e515e83dd9b)
- Integrated with Pipenv for package managing.
- Fast deployment to heroku [in just a few steps here](https://start.4geeksacademy.com/backend/deploy-heroku-posgres).
- Use of .env file.
- SQLAlchemy integration for database abstraction.

## 1) Installation:

> If you use Github Codespaces (recommended) or Gitpod this template will already come with Python, Node and the Posgres Database installed. If you are working locally make sure to install Python 3.10, Node 

It is recomended to install the backend first, make sure you have Python 3.8, Pipenv and a database engine (Posgress recomended)

1. Install the python packages: `$ pipenv install`
2. Create a .env file based on the .env.example: `$ cp .env.example .env`
3. Install your database engine and create your database, depending on your database you have to create a DATABASE_URL variable with one of the possible values, make sure you replace the valudes with your database information:

| Engine    | DATABASE_URL                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite    | sqlite:////test.db                                  |
| MySQL     | mysql://username:password@localhost:port/example    |
| Postgress | postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/example |

4. Migrate the migrations: `$ pipenv run migrate` (skip if you have not made changes to the models on the `./src/api/models.py`)
5. Run the migrations: `$ pipenv run upgrade`
6. Run the application: `$ pipenv run start`

> Note: Codespaces users can connect to psql by typing: `psql -h localhost -U gitpod example`

### Backend Populate Table Users

To insert test users in the database execute the following command:

```sh
$ flask insert-test-users 5
```

And you will see the following message:

```
  Creating test users
  test_user1@test.com created.
  test_user2@test.com created.
  test_user3@test.com created.
  test_user4@test.com created.
  test_user5@test.com created.
  Users created successfully!
```

To update with all yours tables you can edit the file app.py and go to the line 80 to insert the code to populate others tables

### Front-End Manual Installation:

-   Make sure you are using node version 14+ and that you have already successfully installed and runned the backend.

1. Install the packages: `$ npm install`
2. Start coding! start the webpack dev server `$ npm run start`

## Publish your website!

This boilerplate it's 100% read to deploy with Render.com and Heroku in a matter of minutes. Please read the [official documentation about it](https://start.4geeksacademy.com/deploy).
